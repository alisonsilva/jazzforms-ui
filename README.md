# User Interface for the JazzIT product

This is a rich interface developed all with Java FX [see](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/javafx-overview-2158620.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnpt).
It is the interface for the Jazz IT IDE.
Jazz IT aims to be a tool that allows the user to develop mobile applications without the necessity of going through all of that boring development process of creating new projects, developing all the infra structure, etc.


It is the User Interface part of the product. It is a two tier architecture in which the server tier runs in an application server and is written also in java. The communication between the tiers is through JSON REST WebServices.
